This study introduces an innovative system designed to address several
critical issues within the Regional Trial Court, Panabo City, Davao del Norte. These
issues encompass the need for efficient court hearing scheduling and case
tracking, as well as improving accessibility to court hearing schedules and case
information for citizens.
To solve the enumerated challenges, the development team has devised a
comprehensive solution in the form of a Document Information Management
System and Tracking System (DIMTS), complemented by a user-friendly mobile
application. DIMTS is a fully automated system, user-friendly and productive.
Moreover, the system also provides recommendations for the years of sentences
based on the case details using KMeans clustering with the help of the TensorFlow
machine learning platform.
